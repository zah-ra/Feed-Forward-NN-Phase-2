# Feed Forward NN Phase 2

## Description
In this project, we intend to use neural networks to identify the race of each person based on his face image.  We use google colab because of large volume of dataset.
We create a Forward Feed network with the help of the Keras interface, which contains at least two hidden layers (our network has at least 4 layers wiht input and output layers (softmax)).

## Dataset
The [UTKFace](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxYys69jI14kYVM3aVhKS1VhRUk/view?resourcekey=0-dabpv_3J0C0cditpiAfhAw) dataset is a large-scale face dataset with a large age range (from 0 to 116 years). This dataset contains more than 20,000 face images with the age, gender and race of each person. These images cover facial expression, light, sharpness, etc. This dataset is used for example for face recognition, age estimation, age progression/regression, etc.
